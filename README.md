# amyloid-Beta-microglia
MATLAB and Maude code for representing, simulating, and analyzing the cellular and molecular interactions that mediate the reactions of microglia to amyloid-Beta. Additional MATLAB code compares estimates of the efficacy of various drug combinations from the model with those derived from a human Alzheimer's database.
